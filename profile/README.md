## About

### Mission

Our mission is to make volunteering easily accessible and to encourage everyone to share and connect with fellow members of their community.

### Values

#### Altruism

All our work is voluntary! Unlike other charities and nonprofits, our directors volunteer too, so everyone works for free and we can focus our spending on maximising our impact.

#### Transparency

Our finances are completely transparent. We believe that the only way to build trust with our donors is to have full fiscal transparency. Checkout our [finance page](https://voluntree.net/finances) to see how we spend our money.

#### Unity

At Voluntree, everyone’s opinion matters. Therefore, all our volunteers are involved in the decision making process to ensure that our decisions have the community’s best interests at heart. Join us today!

## Platform

Voluntree offers a skill- and knowledge-sharing platform with a difference. Totally transparent and free to use, Voluntree will enable you to help your community, build your reputation and learn some brand new skills! Built on a commitment to the idea that social exchange has real material value, Voluntree is a social experiment platform designed to challenge the conventions of business.

### Launch Date

## Contribute

We are a group of full-time employed young professionals. Our work on this platform happens in our free time and is totally voluntary. It is our dream that the platform itself is run by part-time volunteers just like the volunteers running workshops on the platform.

We are always looking to expand our team with motivated and like-minded people from as many different backgrounds as possible. If this is you, just let us know by filling out [this form](https://voluntree.net/get-involved/), and we'll be in touch as soon as possible!
